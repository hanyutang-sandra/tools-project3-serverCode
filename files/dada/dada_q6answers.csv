"Given that there are many parameters to be considered here, I would test both design patterns against each other in a constrained environment. If the resources were not available to conduct testing in such a manner, I would choose the max-welfare design pattern because it has greater flexibility that the stable pattern, if it doesn't work well I would switch.",6,1.0,A,8.0,8.2,8.1,1.0
I will conduct an experiment to see how the different patterns bring me to and then decide.,6,1.0,A,7.75,7.6,7.675,1.0
"Since the max welfare design pattern suggests that learners be paired for peer-tutoring over multiple sessions so that they gain the maximum from each other in that session, it would be more optimal.",6,0.0,C,6.75,6.4,6.575,0.0
Max-welfare. Because mobile app makes it easier to communicate with different people anytime and anywhere. It also costs less to find a new teammate. It can also use computer-determined methods to find the best pairing.,6,0.0,C,6.75,7.6,7.175,0.0
Conduct a controlled test (or A/B test) to see which pattern yields the best result in our app.,6,1.0,A,8.75,6.8,7.775,1.0
Choose the max-welfare pattern because max-welfare would choose the stable-matching pairing if that were indeed more optimalã€‚,6,0.0,C,9.0,8.3,8.65,0.0
"Since the app allows learners to participate in tutoring over any duration, Max-welfare would be more flexible.",6,0.0,C,7.75,7.0,7.375,0.0
"Since we are in online media, I would pick max-welfare. The reason is that if learners are not required to come to the same classroom by the same time, then it is very hard to ensure that learners in single pair are able to synchronise. Given that online media often assumes self-paced learning it might also be an issue (i.e. I decide to take vacation and my partner should wait till I return). In contrast, max-welfare makes decision for each session and can pick partner from those who are currently online which is very convenient.",6,1.0,A,9.75,8.1,8.925,1.0
A/B testing to compare the two design patterns,6,1.0,A,10.0,6.7,8.35,1.0
"Max-welfare, because people are flowing fast, you cannot tell who will still be here tomorrow, so it's hard to form stable patterns. Rather, pair people with max gain will be more beneficial.",6,0.0,C,7.0,8.0,7.5,0.0
"I might begin with a single question that asks users, given a particular tutoring topic, how long they plan to participate with options of 1) once, 2) less than a month, 3) a month or more. Then I would choose max welfare for options 1 and 2 and stable pairing for option 3. If the option 1 or 2 users began to stay with the app longer, it would switch them to stable pairing.",6,1.0,A,8.0,8.1,8.05,1.0
"We may need further experimental data to decide, so an A/B test is good.",6,1.0,A,8.75,6.7,7.725,1.0
"Since design patterns don't provide a principle to guide us choosing better practices, I suggest trying the easier pattern to implement first (e.g. stable-pairing), then move to max-welfare if results are inadequate",6,0.0,B,7.0,7.3,7.15,0.0
"As both these design patterns have certain learning benefits, I would decide to use Max-welfare because it allows students to choose whether they want to be paired with the same person or not. If they want to be paired with the same person, then they are actually using the stable-pairing design pattern.",6,0.0,C,8.0,6.9,7.45,0.0
"If we want the learner to have the max learning gain, then it's better to use ""Max-welfare"" because learners can experience diverse experience and empathy.",6,0.0,C,7.0,7.8,7.4,0.0
"Assuming these patterns are fairly simple to implement, you could implement both and A/B test them to see which is producing better outcomes or maintaining users better. Opt for the solution fulfilling those metrics better.",6,1.0,A,5.75,6.8,6.275,1.0
"Stable pairing can detract from diversity in learning. As such, it is better to opt for the max welfare pattern.",6,0.0,C,6.75,7.1,6.925,0.0
"I would choose a design pattern that could yield the most gains for learners over the course of their study. Max-welfare design pattern seems to be most aligned with this goal. But most practically, I would suggest moving with stable-pairing first.",6,0.0,B,8.75,6.8,7.775,0.0
"One option could be to differentiate the pairing algorithm based on the time frame for the use case. So if a given user signals that they need only a few sessions, we could use Max-Welfare, but if they will be going back again and again, we use Stable-Pairing",6,1.0,A,8.5,7.5,8.0,1.0
"I would analyze which design pattern matches users' needs when using a smartphone, using properties that are unique to a smartphone environment. One characteristic that the digital tool has is using algorithm to make proper pairs. For that reason, I would choose to use the ""Max-welfare"" pattern over the ""stable-pairing"" pattern.",6,0.0,C,8.0,7.3,7.65,0.0
Test both to see which one works better because there is no adequate/standard way of comparing two solutions and deciding which one is better. Better to be sure than utilize a less optimal method.,6,1.0,A,7.5,7.0,7.25,1.0
The best way is to test both patterns and compare them with each other through AB testing.,6,1.0,A,8.0,7.2,7.6,1.0
"Since these two are competing solutions, I think the designer should make two prototypes to test the result and see which fits the learning goal better.",6,1.0,A,7.75,7.7,7.725,1.0
