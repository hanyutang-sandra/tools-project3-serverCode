"Students are likely to gain the ability to conditionalize the concept, or better understand how it applies or changes according to the scenario in a more refined way. The contrasting cases will mean that student's attention is focused on important features. Because they are participating in invent-then-tell, the students will retain the concept longer as well.",5,0.75,"A,B,C",9.75,8.1,8.925,1.0
They should have a better conceptual understanding and remember it longer compared to a strictly lecture and practice method. They will also do better on transfer tasks.,5,0.75,"A,B,C",8.25,7.2,7.725,1.0
Students will remember these formulae for a long period of time as compared to the just listening to lectures. They will be able to transfer this learning to their final exams as well and not only tests taken after the lesson. Students will also better select right formula for the problem as they know which formula applies for which shape.,5,1.0,"A,C",8.25,6.4,7.325,1.0

invented solutions can help students understand,5,0.25,B,7.25,6.9,7.075,0.0
"Students will have a deeper understanding of the concept of area in general. They will be better at calculate areas in transfer tasks, even after a period of delay.",5,0.25,B,6.75,7.3,7.025,0.0
This type of invent then tell method will promote transfer to other domains and distance transfer over a longer time for students.,5,0.5,"C,D",7.0,8.2,7.6,0.0
"far transfer will be enhanced, deep understanding will be better. However, purely applying formula and tasks mainly involving retentiveness will not be affected.",5,0.5,"B,D",6.75,6.7,6.725,0.0
"Benefits of this methods are (1) delayed recall, students remember the information better for longer and will be able to computer areas for longer (2) pressure transfer task/contextualizing knowledge, more students will use the right formula for area problems after the activity.",5,1.0,"A,C",9.0,7.0,8.0,1.0
"Contrasting cases are helpful for convergent thinking, which leads to come to one correct answer. Invent-with-contrasting-cases (ICC) helps with delayed recall and also helps with contextualize, which can make learners pay more attention to those deeper structures of the problem and is also beneficial to transfer learning.",5,0.5,"A,B,C,D",8.0,6.7,7.35,0.0
"According to research findings, students will understand the deep features better, thus be better at selecting the right formula for the problem. They will perform better in late transfer tasks.",5,0.75,"A,B,C",8.25,7.3,7.775,1.0
"Students would get deeper knowledge of how areas are computed. By inventing, deep structures will have longer retention. Through contrasting cases some contextualization will occur and help similarities become apparent, reinforcing the deep structures invented.",5,0.5,"B,C",8.25,6.8,7.525,0.0
"Contrasting cases can facilitate sense making by indicating key features of the domain's deep structure by highlighting key similarities and differences. This means students are more likely to understand how the formulas relate to the answers they produce, and thereby students may be more deft in their applications, and better able to recall the formulas in the future. I am unsure what ""perceive a better learning"" means. Is this about their metacognitive awareness/perception of their own learning? I.E. they will 'feel' that they learned more?",5,1.0,"A,C",7.0,7.5,7.25,1.0
"They create and test their own hypothesis, which helps with far-transfer.",5,0.25,B,8.0,8.0,8.0,0.0
